= Prism

Prism's intention is to be a generic syntax highlighter, ie a one that you can 
extend **easily**.

At the moment, there's only 3 grammar files [Ruby, Falcon, XML], but adding 
more is a matter of writting a few regexps inside a state machine.

== Usage

After instanciating an HL object (witch needs a Formatter),like ie :

{{{
formatter = HtmlFormatter.new()
h = HL.new(formatter, "rb")
}}}

There are 3 methods avaible with your HL instance:

* from_string(code_in_text)
* from_list(code_in_array)
* from_file(in_file, out_file)

See and launch the 'test1.rb' file, then go into the 'output_test_files' 
directory to see your generated 'out.html' file.

If you want view other themes, just edit 'main.css' and change the theme
accordingly to your need.
